# lumi
The service that luminates the way and prevent seizures before your YouTube video even starts

# What it does

Lumi is a chrome extension that detects a video from any popular streaming service, and normalizes the video 
from any seizure inducing clips with the help of flashai's other sweet services such as our api, gleam and our in house
AI, shine. 

# How it works

Lumi grabs the url and sends it to gleam to let gleam work it's magic, upon the API's response, we now have a seizure inducing 
free video to display to the user.
